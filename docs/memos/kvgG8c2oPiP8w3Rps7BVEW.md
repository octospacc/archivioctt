Google Safe Browsing, service from Google that warns users when they attempt to navigate to a dangerous website or download dangerous files:
* https://safebrowsing.google.com/
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Safe_Browsing
* Check site status: https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search
* Report malware: https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_badware
* Report phishing: https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish
* Report site wrongly classified as dangerous: https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_error
It's integrated by default in browsers, including Firefox (but it seems not open-source Chromium) and that's a problem; not just for of privacy (leaking hashes of sites to Google) but because of false positives (annoying for savyy users and destructive for noobs).
Instead, it doesn't even work for blocking actually bad sites (no warning when visiting phishing links from email or SMS, and no warning for sites redistributing freeware with trojans).
