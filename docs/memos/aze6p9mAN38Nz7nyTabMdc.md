A tip when crawling is to always disable "Accept URLs with query-part ('?')" for any website, except when totally necessary (eg. phpBB forums, which write the topic id in the query part), otherwise effectively duplicate pages will be enlisted for the majority of sites, degrading the search.
There's also the Searchlab portal which I don't exactly understand:
