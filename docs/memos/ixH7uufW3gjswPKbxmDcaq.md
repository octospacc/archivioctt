# The hidden web browser on the Nintendo Switch:
The hidden web browser on the Nintendo Switch:
* BrowseNX, Launches the browser via nsp: https://github.com/crc-32/BrowseNX
* Make YOUR OWN Switch Apps: https://youtu.be/vOmPuNJyNCI â€” Tutorial for making dummy NSP apps that open embedded HTML content on the copyright information option, very old and should be tested after 6 years
A big issue of the browser is it gets forcibly closed after a while (time seems to be variable). There is currently no fix (not even the homebrews above). Might need to do more experiments with apps using the system webview in the future, and also try different runtime flags for a devkitpro web libapplet homebrew program.
