# `reddit.com/domain/...` is an obscure Reddit feature that lists posts created as links (don't think it counts text posts) to a specific domain, it's so unused that even from the modern domain it's displayed with the old style, but it's probably useful. Example: https://www.reddit.com/domain/example.com/
