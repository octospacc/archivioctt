Distro package search sites and services:
* [pkgs.org](https://pkgs.org), Packages for Linux and Unix: the most complete but really bad UX, recently too frequent captchas, always tries to upsell to premium, proprietary garbage and not even selfhostable
* Repology, the packaging hub: https://repology.org | https://github.com/repology
* [release-monitoring.org](https://release-monitoring.org) aka Anitya, cross-distribution upstream release monitoring project | https://github.com/fedora-infra/anitya
* whohas is a command line tool that allows querying several package lists at once: http://philippwesche.org/200811/whohas/intro.html | https://github.com/whohas/whohas
