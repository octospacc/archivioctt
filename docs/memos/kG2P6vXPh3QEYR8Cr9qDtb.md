lemmyBB: A Lemmy frontend based on phpBB 3.3.
* https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmyBB
Pretty nice but as of 2024:
* Uses a different template format from the real phpBB, and only the prosilver theme is ported, meaning using any other theme will require (manual?) porting of the HTML
* Development is dead and the software doesn't work with recent versions of Lemmy (what did they develop it for?)
  * The only 2 known instances using it are dead
