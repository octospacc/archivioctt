# VuePress, Vue-powered Static Site Generator:
VuePress, Vue-powered Static Site Generator:
* https://vuepress.vuejs.org/
* https://github.com/vuepress/core
* https://github.com/vuepress/awesome-vuepress
* Create YOUR next static blog in Vuepress and Vue: https://softchris.github.io/pages/vue-vuepress.html
Mainly meant for documentation, but has many blog themes. However, building a site is kinda slow and pulling dependencies even slower, and themes after some years not being maintaned stop working... Also navigation menus are totally broken without JS in almost any theme around, including default one.
