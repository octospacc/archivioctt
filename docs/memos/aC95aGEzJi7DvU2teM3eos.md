Translate Shell/translate-shell, a shell for translating text for free using scraping of online translation services (Google, Bing, Yandex, ...). Apparently 2 versions are around:
* by soimort, formerly Google Translate CLI, works the best, with many options, but is only a bash+AWK script, and streams the result text extremely slow: https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell | https://www.soimort.org/translate-shell
* by Freed-Wu, offers Python API and works fast, but gets bugged on long text (?): https://github.com/Freed-Wu/translate-shell | https://pypi.org/project/translate-shell/ | https://translate-shell.readthedocs.io
