# The man that will destroy YouTube, Roel Van de Paar:
The man that will destroy YouTube, Roel Van de Paar:
* His channel, also referred to as Roel's Technical Help: https://www.youtube.com/@RoelVandePaar
* DistroTube â€” The Man That Uploaded 2 Million Videos To YouTube: https://youtube.com/watch?v=Olkb7fYSyiI
There are copycats (!):
* Peter Schneider: https://www.youtube.com/@peterschneiderQandA
They have this in common:
* Tens or hundred of videos uploaded every day
* Simple thumbnail with a few recycled elements, maybe cosmetics and background, and then text repeating the title of the video
* Video is titled after technical questions found on web Q/A tech forums
* The intro is the channel protagonist outside walking somewhere, basically faking a vlog, introducing the fact that the video will answer the question that's posed in the title but never actually spoken
* The actual content is text from the web source displayed on screen with royalty-free background music
