# `nodebb-plugin-link-preview`, Rich Embeds and Link Previews plugin for NodeBB:
`nodebb-plugin-link-preview`, Rich Embeds and Link Previews plugin for NodeBB:
* https://github.com/NodeBB/nodebb-plugin-link-preview
* https://community.nodebb.org/topic/17384/nodebb-plugin-link-preview-rich-embeds-and-link-previews
This only expands links that are on their own line and with at least one empty line above and below (including if the link is on the last line, probably a bug?), aka doesn't expand links in content paragraphs for obvious reasons.
