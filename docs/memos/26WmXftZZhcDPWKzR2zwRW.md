A lot of version existed and/or are currently available:
* Normal: https://www.vmos.cn/product_center.htm
  * 2021 Android 5 Lollipop: https://files.vmos.cn/vmVersion/2021051317112829984.apk
  * 2024 Android 9 Pie: https://files.vmos.cn/vmVersion/2024060420460029001.apk
* PRO (which is free too for some reason): https://www.vmos.cn/product_center_vmospro.htm
  * Older APKs: https://vmos-pro.it.uptodown.com/android
* Google Play (not working?): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vmos.google
International website has been discontinued and now redirects to their cloud VM website, seems like they want to push it to earn money instead of fixing the normal emulator issues.
