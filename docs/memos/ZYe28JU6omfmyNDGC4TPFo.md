# Running PHP in JavaScript / translating or transpiling PHP to JS?
Running PHP in JavaScript / translating or transpiling PHP to JS?
Some solutions are there but experimental and broken:
* *php2js*, tool that can automatically translate PHP code into Javascript code: https://github.com/dan-da/php2js
* Locutus *PHP extensions in JavaScript* (stdlib): https://locutus.io/php/
  * https://github.com/locutusjs/locutus/tree/main/src/php
Otherwise one can use PHP WASM.
