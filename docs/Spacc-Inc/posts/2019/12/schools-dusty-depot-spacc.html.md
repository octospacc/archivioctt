Fortnite wasn't enough. On the last day of school before the winter break, I stumbled across this walking in the corridors. I can't say with absolute certainty the day this "placeholder window" was spacced but surely it is recent. I could have taken this photo going close to the spacc, I know, but I'm lazy and honestly the only thing a normal student wants on the last day of school is to go home, maybe F O R E V E R.</span></span></span></div>

There's probably a lot of spacced things inside, and it surely is super dusty.</span></span></span></div>
