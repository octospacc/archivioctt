Xiaomeme spacc omg lol. Remember the sir that sent me all those spacced phones? He's back, and this time with his ded mi max 3. For some time while charging this meme used to warm up a lot and the touch panel to register false inputs. He says "I connect it and it warms up. After two minutes, poof".<br />
After this he still wants a xiaomeme. Stupid ass. Poor boi.<br />
Ah also, he tried to contact Amazon's Customer Service to have the phone replaced, but the Roman guy he got in contact with said the spacc is caused by an improper usage and so he can't have the meme replaced. He now hopes the Colosseum does spacc and falls down under its own weight. Spacc ðŸ¦œ.</div>
