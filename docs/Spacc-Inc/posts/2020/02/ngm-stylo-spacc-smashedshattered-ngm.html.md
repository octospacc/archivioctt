<span style="font-family: &quot;trebuchet ms&quot; , sans-serif;">After some mid-range and flagship smartphones, today we have an 80â‚¬ phone spacc. As always, it's from a friend, who had this poor ngm stylo smashed about 3 years ago. I remember it was a shitty phone, the battery used to jump from 100 to 30 percent in less than half an hour, and it lagged constantly, but I can't quite remember how the glass got shattered. Maybe he raged and threw it on the ground, or maybe his father did that, one thing is sure: the LCD now shows some lines of random colours (sorry if I don't have a photo of that now) and the touch panel also died. What can we say... Spacc.</span></div>
