The sir whixard is back at it, and gravity is, as always, being an asshole. Well, what happened then? The sur was presumably using its smartphone, accidentally dropped it on the ground, and it immediately became a spaccphone. Fortunately the screen itself hasn't been damaged and is perfectly working, but the front glass.. obtained a little spacc. It's cracked on the corner, as you can see in the picture. The thing is, the phone had also a cover on in the moment it decided to commit self-spacc. Can you see it? Of course not! Because it's one of those shitty covers that don't even cover the screen corners and borders.. which are the most delicate parts of a smartphone.. what could I say, if not.. S p a c c ?<br /></span></div>
