<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you could see from the title, in this post we will be tackling Apple's parrot.<br>This bad boi right here was introduced on the iOS 12.1 update, which makes him (when the review is being made) a quite young parrot.<br>Is he a sir though? We will find out with this very scientific review, made following our typical criteria.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Colors - 5 / 5</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think this parrot nails that part perfectly. I personally feel like every pattor ever should be green, and this one does that.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://pattors.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pattor-palette-2.png?w=600" alt="" class="wp-image-73" /><figcaption>Here are his main colors, in order: Green (82AA3A), Yellow (F7EC5A), Red (B81600)</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Face - 4.5 / 5</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I believe it looks just as good, and truly expresses a parrot's sirness. However, a closer inspection shows that this parrot's beak is too large, and this will cost him half a star.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":67,"width":72,"height":59,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://pattors.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/face.png?w=44" alt="" class="wp-image-67" width="72" height="59" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Body - 4 / 5</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This does leave something to be desired, because of the rather weird looking and too thin shaft, though it is made up for by his standing position, which totally gives him his cool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":68,"width":83,"height":126,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://pattors.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/body.png?w=55" alt="" class="wp-image-68" width="83" height="126" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Legs - 5 / 5</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There's not much to say, they just are really nice legs, thicc where they should be and sturdy looking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":69,"width":105,"height":31,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://pattors.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/legs.png?w=61" alt="" class="wp-image-69" width="105" height="31" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Feather - 5 / 5</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These feathers are smoothened where they should be, fade nicely and give him a very sir look. We don't get any complex patterns, but that's okay for an emoji.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":70,"width":92,"height":84,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://pattors.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/feather.png?w=73" alt="" class="wp-image-70" width="92" height="84" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Body proportions - 4 / 5</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And lastly, he's got a quite nice body with the right proportions, with a very emoji-y look (no shit).<br>A shorter neck would've been nice though.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>And finally, the results - 4.5 / 5</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><!-- wp:table -->

<!-- /wp:table --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So that was it. I'm more than happy to announce that this pattor has passed our tests and is therefore a true sir.</p>
